import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

We protect the Login and Consent flows using CSRF Cookies. This mitigates
several attack vectors but can lead cause issues when misconfigured. The most
common causes of CSRF issues are the following:

- You are mixing domains with IP addresses in your request - for example using
  `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` in the same flow.
- You are running ORY Hydra via HTTP but are missing the
  `--dangerous-force-http` CLI flag.
- You are running the OAuth2 flow in separate browsers, or in a browser with
  incognito mode. The Brave browser is also known for notoriously discarding
  cookies when used in "No-Tracking" mode.
- You are running ORY Hydra behind a Reverse Proxy (e.g. Load Balancer) that
  strips the Cookie header. If the reverse proxy supports path rewrites that
  might also cause issues!
- You are trying to do two OAuth2 flows at the same time in the same Browser.
- You have changed the Cookie SameSite behavior. If this is the default value
  (you did not change it), this should not be an issue.

:::warning

You **cannot** call `/oauth2/auth` using an AJAX request. It is not allowed
and not possible with OAuth2. This endpoint can only be accessed using a normal
browser request.
